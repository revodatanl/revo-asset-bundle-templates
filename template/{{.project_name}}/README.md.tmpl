{{.description}}

The `{{.project_name}}` Bundle was generated by using the [RevoData Asset Bundle Template](https://github.com/revodatanl/revo-asset-bundle-templates) version `0.8.0`.

## Prerequisites

The project heavily depends on the provided `Makefile` for various tasks. Without [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) installed, you will need to run the commands described in the `Makefile` manually.

Note that on **Windows** most commands need to be adjusted to function properly.

## Installation

With [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) installed, run the following command to install the prerequisites:

```bash
make install
```

This will install the following prerequisites:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh){{if not (eq .python_only "yes")}}
- [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli.html){{end}}
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs) >= 1.6.1
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

## Set up the development environment

To set up a fully configured development environment for this project run the following command:

```bash
make setup
```

This will use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to configure the correct [Python](https://www.python.org/) version specified in the `.python-version` file. Subsequently it will use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to install the dependencies, set up a virtual environment, activate it, and install the pre-commit hooks.
{{if not (eq .python_only "yes")}}
Note that the default project configuration matches Databricks Runtime 14.3 LTS (Python 3.10.12, Apache Spark 3.5.0, and pandas 1.5.3).

## Clean up the development environment

The following commands are available for development:

```bash
make clean
```

This command deactivates the virtual environment, removes the virtual environment and the `poetry.lock` file, and removes any caches.

## RevoData Modules

To add our custom modules to your project, run the following command:

```bash
make module
```

![make-module](docs/assets/make-module.png)

## Create GitHub repository

To create a repository in RevoData's GitHub, and add a remote to the local git repository containing the Bundle, use the following commands:

```bash
make repo
```

This assumes that the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) is installed, and access to the RevoData GitHub organization is granted and configured.

## Bundle Deployment

To deploy the Bundle to the appropriate Databricks workspace, use the following commands:

```bash
make deploy_*
```

The `*` in the command above can be replaced with the following options: `dev` or `prd`.

![make-deploy_dev](docs/assets/make-deploy_dev.png)

## Bundle Destruction

To remove the Bundle from the Databricks workspace, use the following command:

```bash
make destroy_*
```

The `*` in the command above can be replaced with the following options: `dev` or `prd`.

## Documentation

To build the documentation for the `{{.project_name}}` project, run the following command:

```bash
make docs
```
