{{.project_description}}

The `{{.project_name}}` project was generated from [RevoData Asset Bundle Templates](https://github.com/revodatanl/revo-asset-bundle-templates) version `0.15.3`.

## Prerequisites

This project heavily depends on the provided `Makefile` for various tasks. Without [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) installed, you will need to run the commands described in the `Makefile` manually.

The project is natively built for **Linux** or **macOS**. For **Windows** we suggest developing in a **[DevContainer](devcontainer.md) (recommended)** or setting up a **[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](wsl.md)** environment.

## Quick Start

```bash
make setup    # Set up development environment
make lint     # Run linting
make test     # Run tests
make deploy   # Deploy bundle to default workspace
make destroy  # Destroy bundle resources on default workspace
```
