{{.project_description}}

The `{{.project_name}}` project was generated from [RevoData Asset Bundle Templates](https://github.com/revodatanl/revo-asset-bundle-templates) version `0.17.1`.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** - Fast Python package manager and project management
- **[git](https://git-scm.com/)** - Version control system
- **[Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/index.html)** - Command-line interface for Databricks operations
- **[make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)** - Build automation tool (very convenient during development)

**Platform Support**: This project is designed for **Linux** and **macOS**. Windows users should use a **DevContainer** or **[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](docs/wsl.md) (recommended)** for the best development experience.

## Quick Start

Set up a fully configured development environment by running:

```bash
make
```

You may need to update the `PROFILE_NAME` variable in the `Makefile` to match your Databricks profile name.  In addition, ensure that the host URL in `bundle/targets.yml` matches your Databricks profile URL.

Additional `make` commands are available for various tasks:

```bash
make lint     # Run linting
make test     # Run tests
make validate # Validate bundle on default workspace
make deploy   # Deploy bundle to default workspace
make destroy  # Destroy bundle resources on default workspace
```
