{{.project_description}}

The `{{.project_name}}` project was generated from [RevoData Asset Bundle Templates](https://github.com/revodatanl/revo-asset-bundle-templates) version `0.18.7`.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** - Fast Python package manager and project management
- **[git](https://git-scm.com/)** - Version control system
- **[Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/index.html)** - Command-line interface for Databricks operations
- **[just](https://just.systems/man/en/packages.html)** - Build automation tool (very convenient during development)

**Platform Support**: This project is designed for **Linux**, **macOS** and **Windows**.

## Quick Start

Set up a fully configured development environment by running:

```bash
just
```

You may need to update the `PROFILE_NAME` variable in the `.justfile` to match your Databricks profile name.  In addition, ensure that the host URL in `databricks.yml` matches your Databricks profile URL.

Additional `just` commands are available for various tasks:

```bash
just lint     # Run linting
just test     # Run tests
just validate # Validate bundle on default workspace
just deploy   # Deploy bundle to default workspace
just destroy  # Destroy bundle resources on default workspace
```

Run `just list` to see all available commands.
