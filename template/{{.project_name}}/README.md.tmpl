{{.project_description}}

The `{{.project_name}}` project was generated from [RevoData Asset Bundle Templates](https://github.com/revodatanl/revo-asset-bundle-templates) version `0.15.3`.

## Prerequisites

This project heavily depends on the provided `Makefile` for various tasks. Without [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) installed, you will need to run the commands described in the `Makefile` manually.

The project is natively built for **Linux** or **macOS**. For **Windows** we suggest developing in a **DevContainer** or setting up a **[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](wsl.md)** environment (recommended).

## Quick Start

Set up a fully configured development environment by running:

```bash
make (setup)
```

You may need to update the `PROFILE_NAME` variable in the `Makefile` to match your Databricks profile name.  In addition, ensure that the host URL in `bundle/targets.yml` matches your Databricks profile URL.

Additional `make` commands are available for various tasks:

```bash
make lint     # Run linting
make test     # Run tests
make validate # Validate bundle on default workspace
make deploy   # Deploy bundle to default workspace
make destroy  # Destroy bundle resources on default workspace
```
