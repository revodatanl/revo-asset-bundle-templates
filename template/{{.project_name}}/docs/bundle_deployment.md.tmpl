# Deployment

[Databricks Asset Bundles](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/bundles/) enable software engineering best practices for data and AI projects through source control, code review, testing, and CI/CD.
Bundles define your entire project—structure, tests, and deployment—as source files, making collaboration seamless.

A bundle contains:

- Cloud infrastructure and workspace configurations
- Business logic (notebooks, Python files)
- Resource definitions (jobs, pipelines, Model Serving endpoints, MLflow experiments)
- Unit and integration tests

The following diagram provides a high-level view of a development and CI/CD pipeline with bundles:

## Git Strategy

We use a **hybrid trunk-based approach**:

- **Jobs/Pipelines** follow a [**GitHub Flow**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) process (deploy from `main` with an approval gate; no persistent release branches).
- **Models** follow [**Microsoft Release Flow**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/how-microsoft-develops-devops) (cut `release/*` branches for production; hotfix on release and merge-forward).

Across both, we keep branches short-lived and integrate via `main`.

### Branch types used

| Branch | Purpose | Lifecycle | Used by |
|--------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **main** | Integration branch, always buildable | Permanent | Jobs/Pipelines & Models |
| **feature** | Feature development and bug fixes | Short-lived (days) | Jobs/Pipelines & Models |
| **release/\*** | Production release and servicing line | Long-lived (read-only after tagging) | **Models only** |

### Core Principles

- **Short-lived features**: Merge within days, not weeks.
- **Main-first**: All development flows through `main`.
- **Hotfixes**:
  - **Jobs/Pipelines** → fix on a branch → PR to `main` → redeploy latest.
  - **Models** → fix on a branch off the affected `release/*` → PR back to that release → **merge-forward** to newer release branches and `main`.
- **Semantic versioning**: Automated version bumps based on commit type.

### Deployment Strategy

Our projects typically have two components with different deployment cadences:

- **Jobs/Pipelines**: Data processing logic (infrequent updates)
- **Models**: Prediction services (regular updates)

Both share the same trunk-first workflow and CI/CD, but **only models use release branches**; jobs/pipelines use an approval gate on `main` for production.

## Bundle Deployment

The following diagram illustrates how bundles are promoted through development, test, and production environments.

![bundle-deployment](images/bundle-deployment.png)

The bundle deployment process follows a progressive promotion strategy:

1. **Development** (`dev`)
   - Manual deployment from feature branches
   - Isolated testing environment
   - Deployment through command: `databricks bundle deploy` (or `just deploy`)

2. **Test** (`test`)
   - Automatic deployment on updated repo tag
   - Integration testing and validation
   - Deployment through pipeline: `cd.yml`

3. **Production** (`prod`)
   - **Jobs/Pipelines**: Manual approval gate after test validation (deploy from `main`, no release branch)
   - **Models**: Create a `release/*` branch from `main` to trigger production deployment (Release Flow)
   - Deployment through pipeline: `cd.yml`

## MLOps Deployment

Models require more sophisticated deployment strategies due to frequent updates, the need for A/B testing, champion/challenger patterns; therefore **Models follow Microsoft Release Flow.**

![mlops-deployment](images/mlops-deployment.png)

In this example we are referring to the champion model by `M1` and the challenger model by `M2`.

1. **Development Phase**
   - Model challenger developed on feature branches
   - Manual deployments to `dev`, gradually promoting to `test`
   - Current champion model remains active in production

2. **Testing Phase**
   - Merge to `main` triggers deployment to `test`
   - **Champion/Challenger pattern**:
     - Model marked as champion processes all data
     - Model marked as challenger processes a data subset
   - Performance comparison metrics evaluated

3. **Production Release (Release Flow)**
   - Create a `release/*` branch from `main` to trigger production deployment
   - **Role reversal**:
     - Challenger becomes champion and processes all data
     - Former champion becomes challenger and processes a subset
   - **Servicing**: Hotfixes are made on the relevant `release/*` branch and **merged forward** to newer release branches and `main`
   - Release branches are long-lived and read-only outside servicing

## CI/CD

Our automated pipeline orchestrates testing, deployment, and versioning across all environments. Three main pipelines are defined in our workflow. A graphical overview of the full CI/CD process is shown at the bottom of the page.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

The `CI` pipeline ensures code quality and bundle functionality before merging.

**Trigger**: Pull request to any branch
**Pipeline**: {{if (eq .cicd_provider "azure")}}`.azure/.azure-pipelines/ci.yml`{{end}}{{if (eq .cicd_provider "github")}}`.github/workflows/ci.yml`{{end}}

**Steps**:

1. Environment setup and dependency installation
2. Code quality checks (`ruff`, `mypy`, `pydoclint`)
3. Unit test execution with coverage reporting
4. Bundle validation and build verification

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

The `CD` pipeline automates Databricks Asset Bundle deployments across environments. The pipeline ensures consistent deployments while maintaining proper governance through environment-specific configurations and approval workflows.

**Trigger**: Merge to main branch
**Pipeline**: {{if (eq .cicd_provider "azure")}}`.azure/.azure-pipelines/cd.yml`{{end}}{{if (eq .cicd_provider "github")}}`.github/workflows/cd.yml`{{end}}

**Flow**:

1. Automatic Databricks Asset Bundle deployment to test environment
2. Integration test execution
3. Manual approval gate (12-hour timeout)
4. Production deployment upon approval (**from `main` for jobs/pipelines; from `release/*` for models**)

### Semantic Release

The `semantic-release` pipeline automates versioning and changelog generation based on commit messages, ensuring consistent and predictable releases.

**Trigger**: Merge to main branch
**Pipeline**: {{if (eq .cicd_provider "azure")}}`.azure/.azure-pipelines/semantic-release.yml`{{end}}{{if (eq .cicd_provider "github")}}`.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml`{{end}}
**Configuration**: `release.config.mjs`

**Flow**:

The pipeline analyzes commit messages to determine the next version number:

| Commit Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `fix:` | triggers a **patch** version update | `1.0.0` → `1.0.1` |
| `feat:` | triggers a **minor** version update | `1.0.0` → `1.1.0` |
| `*!:` | triggers a **major** version update | `1.0.0` → `2.0.0` |

The appropriate version number is then automatically updated in the repository.

#### Automated `CHANGELOG` Generation

As part of the release process, we auto-generate a comprehensive `CHANGELOG`. The `CHANGELOG` is automatically updated with each release, capturing all notable changes, enhancements, bug fixes, and breaking changes based on the commit messages.

### Graphical Overview

This figure illustrates the ideal end-to-end flow from code change to production. A developer creates a `feature` branch, commits changes (protected by pre-commit hooks), then opens a pull request (PR). The three pipelines now run in succession:

1. The `CI` pipeline runs automatically on the PR; only when it passes can the PR be merged to `main`.
2. The `semantic-release` pipeline is triggered on the merge event, which interprets commit messages to bump the version, updates the `CHANGELOG`, and applies a git tag.
3. The `CD` pipeline is triggered on the tagging event, which deploys the bundle through `test` and on to `prod` per manual approval gates.

> **Note on Semantic Release:** in many organizations the `main` branch is protected, so commits for the version bump and updated `CHANGELOG` may be disallowed or hard to set up. In those cases, configure Semantic Release to publish a tag-only release.
